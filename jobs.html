        <p>HATCX is an incubator service for the development of healthcare innovations and products. We believe in creating easy, simple solutions to a complex industry. We want to empower you with the right tools to make the best personal health decisions. We want to innovate where innovation is needed most—to bring transparency to service, give you control of your personal health information and make it easy to access.</p>
        <p>Ultimately we want to change the way you think about and use healthcare.</p>
