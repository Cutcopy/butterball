        <li>Use of Cookies
          <p>Session cookies may be used on this website or application. These cookies reside within the web browser.  They are typically cleared as soon as the visitor closes the web browser although some browsers have options to retain session cookies. Session cookies can be used by web site operators to determine information such as what parts of a web site are popular, how long people stay on certain sections of a web site and what browsers people are using.</p>
          <p>Certain authorized HATCX vendors may help us with the delivery of HATCX marketing messages by placing and reading cookies. We require that these vendors participate in the opt‐out process established by the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). To learn more or to limit the automatic collection of information by these parties, you may visit the NAI advertising industry site and opt out of this collection. Please note that this opt‐out is cookie‐based. If you buy a new computer, change Web browsers or delete cookies, you will need to perform the opt‐out task again. Please also note that the NAI opt‐out does not work on many wireless devices, wireless portals, or wireless Web sites. You also can limit the automatic collection of certain information by our or other Web sites. Most Internet browsers residing on computers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.</p>

          <p>Private health information you give us will be used to provide services to you, answer your questions, or otherwise do business with you. Other types of individually identifiable personal information, such as names, postal and e‐mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to HATCX may be added to our databases and be used for future calls and mailings regarding site or application updates, new products and services and upcoming events.

Such entities will be under a contractual obligation to use the information solely for the purposes of their work on our behalf. We do not sell or transfer your personal information to nonaffiliated entities for their marketing purposes. We may release any information, including individually identifiable personal information, when we believe in good faith that such release is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Necessary to comply with the law or a valid court order.</li>
            <li>Helpful in responding to your communication.</li>
